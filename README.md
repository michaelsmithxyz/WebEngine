This is a toy to learn about HTML / CSS parsing and rendering. Hopefully this
will ultimately end up as a simple renderer which can lay out and render a subset
of HTML styled with a subset of CSS.

## Progress
This is a side project and an early work-in-progress, so I'm including a list
of features to add in order to track the state of this repository as I work on
this in my spare time:

- [X] Minimal HTML parsing support
- [X] Minimal CSS selector parsing support
- [-] Minimal CSS stylesheet parsing support
- [ ] Style application to DOM nodes
- [ ] Box-model tree construction
- [ ] Layout construction
- [ ] Rendering
- [ ] Text content rendering
